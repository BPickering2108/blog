      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;conundrums&#34;&gt;Conundrums&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-day-is-it&#34;&gt;What day is it?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had the (un)lucky task of covering out of hours on call over New Years, and so was woken up at 03:00 on New Years Eve to encounter an issue where errors were streaming in from our FTP platform - most notably the process which transfers orders from the website into our warehouse management system (WMS). After some quick investigation, I noticed that the affected jobs looked to only be those communicating with our Azure Blob storages.
After I had confirmed no changes to the environment from our side, the manager on call alerted the internal team who support our WMS and the external 3rd party who support our website. I then started investigating the start time of the errors - exactly midnight! At this point, a Microsoft support engineer was called in to advise and confirmed the hypothesis - the leap year had led to some confusion in the FTP system, and it was unable to authenticate with the provided credentials.
Unfortunately, while the MS engineer was able to advise the suspected root cause (we were his 3rd customer just that morning), the advice was that the issue was with the FTP platform, not Azure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The next step here was obvious. Get coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After grinding up some slow-roasted Italian beans and slowing pulling the flavour out from them (read: Nespresso machine), I raised a support ticket with the FTP support. While waiting for a response, I was then having to manually retrieve order information, and load the files into the WMS to ensure continuation of service (no orders were harmed in the making of this story). FTP support then responded to my distress call by confirming that there was an error, but the cause was from Azure and there was nothing more they could do. Queue the back and forth between two mighty service providers, while I sat in the middle drinking coffee and transferring XML files&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this point, the sun had risen and it was time to go to the office. We&amp;rsquo;d agreed to a 9am catch up call to determine if anything else had changed (spoiler alert: it had not). Thankfully, the WMS support team were then able to put in a better workaround than me manually transferring the files, and I left my management to battle it out with FTP support management, who at this point would not confirm any issue on their end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My New Year celebrations at midnight then consisted of me logging in to see if the issue had resolved itself (as was speculated) and thankfully all was good! I could see files happily making there way into Azure again and everything was right with the world. After an 18 hour work day (punctuated by a short nap), I logged off and went to sleep!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;learning&#34;&gt;Learning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve started studying towards earning my SC-300 (Identity and Access Management) certification from Microsoft, and am also looking at getting some wider industry certs under my belt - any recommendations, please give me a shout in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;early-days&#34;&gt;Early Days&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From an early age, gaming wasn&amp;rsquo;t just a pastime for me; it was the gateway to a lifelong fascination with technology. I remember the thrill of assembling my first gaming PC with support from friends in April 2020. This experience ignited my interest in coding, leading me to experiment with Python, even if my initial projects were more fun than functional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;first-it-job&#34;&gt;First IT Job&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving the familiar routine of McDonald&amp;rsquo;s in August 2021, after spending the first 5 years of my working life there, I plunged into the exciting yet daunting world of IT. My first role at New Look’s help desk felt like stepping into uncharted territory, but I was eager to prove myself. I was hired on a fixed-term contract, with principal responsibility of managing the iPad devices that were used in the retail stores daily which included provisioning the devices, amending the build being applied, managing the CMDB (Configuration Management Database), and organising the logistics of both shipping the devices to stores, and collecting faulty devices. For those unaware, a CMDB holds data relating to IT assets. Only a few months down the line, I was offered a permanent position which increased my responsibilities to also include supporting end users across offices and retail stores with basic IT support requests.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;continuation-of-it-career&#34;&gt;Continuation of IT Career&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March the following year, I then moved up to the 2nd line End User Compute team, where I started taking more responsibility for supporting our end users with more complex queries, learning PowerShell, and diving deeper into the workings of a computer - as well as being encouraged to work towards some Microsoft Certifications by my line management. While working in the EUC team, I was able to earn 3 foundation certifications (Azure, M365, Security &amp;amp; Compliance) as well as the now retired M365 Security Administrator Associate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July 2023, I was then given the massive opportunity to work with the 3rd line Technical Services team on a secondment to be a direct link between infrastructure support and security operations. This involved moving away from previous AV solution and onboarding the new solution, managing the patching of the server estate, and utilising Azure Resource Manager, through Azure Arc, to start automated patching of less critical servers. This secondment gave me vital server management and troubleshooting skills, which then made me a prime candidate for the full time position which I gained in December 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;future-goals&#34;&gt;Future Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, I have developed my skills across areas of computing including web design, PowerShell, FTP, PKI and certificates, and identity and access management. I intend to continue my journey moving forward by investigating infrastructure as code, notably Terraform, and penetration testing skills. The idea behind this blog is to track my efforts, as well as to give me a platform to reflect on new technologies and things I have learned.&lt;/p&gt;
